# OpenAPI Documentation

To access an up-to-date description of our REST endpoints, generated based on this repository, start the Swagger server using:

```sh
cd docs && docker compose up -d
```

Now point your browser to:

```default
http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/
```

**NOTE** The request feature of the Swagger UI is not intended for use and is therefore unsupported.

=====================

To access an up-to-date description of our REST endpoints, generated based on this repository, start the Swagger server using:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd docs && docker compose up -d

Now point your browser to:

.. code-block::

**NOTE** The request feature of the Swagger UI is not intended for use and is therefore unsupported.
